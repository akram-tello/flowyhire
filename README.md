While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`build`|build the application to disk (`.next` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon for the server as well.|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
